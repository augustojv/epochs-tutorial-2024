					Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become the <em>de facto</em> solution to drive human
					progress and more specifically, automation. In the last years, the world’s economy has been gravitating towards the AI/ML
					domain (from industrial and scientific perspectives) and the expectation of growth is not withering away. In more recent years,
					a new trend towards very large AI models has been gaining traction: <em>Foundation Models</em>. Large Foundation Models with
					billions or trillions of parameters exhibit astonishing emergent skills, especially in fields like natural language processing,
					vision, and human-machine interaction. Examples like BERT (110M parameters), GPT-2 (1.5B parameters), GPT-3 (175B parameters), BLOOM
					(176B parameters), and Wu Dao (1.75T parameters!) indicate that the size of these models will keep growing rapidly and substantially
					in the foreseeable future. This results in all sorts of challenges, especially with respect to provisioning the computing resources
					needed for training and inferencing, and calls for thorough co-design across algorithms, models, software, and hardware systems.
				    </p>
					<p>
					In this context, this edition of the <strong>CogArch workshop</strong> aims at bringing together the necessary know-how to address
					co-designed hardware-software architectures from a holistic point of view, tackling all their design considerations from the algorithms
					to platforms in all the different fields that large-scale cognitive systems will soon occupy, from natural language processing and speech
					to other applications like protein folding, drug discovery, computer vision or even music generation.
				    </p>
					<p> 
					The <strong>CogArch workshop</strong> already had six successful editions, bringing together experts and knowledge on the most novel
					design ideas for cognitive systems. This workshop capitalizes on the synergy between industrial and academic efforts in order to provide
					a better understanding of cognitive systems and key concepts of their design.
                    </p>

                    <p>
					Hardware and software design considerations are gravitating towards AI applications, as those have been proven extremely useful in a wide
					variety of fields, from edge computing in autonomous cars, to cloud-based computing for personalized medicine. Recent years have witnessed
					the emergence of AI at a very large scale: <em>Foundation Models</em>. Large Foundation Models with billions or trillions of parameters exhibit
					astonishing emergent skills, especially in fields like natural language processing, vision, content creation, and human-machine interaction.
					The unprecedented number of parameters in these models, though, generates all sorts of new challenges, especially with respect to provisioning
					the computing resources needed for training and inferencing, and calls for thorough co-design across algorithms, models, software, and hardware
					systems.
				    </p>
					<p>
					The <strong>CogArch workshop</strong> solicits formative ideas and new product offerings in the general space of AI systems that covers all the
					design aspects of cognitive systems, <strong>with particular focus this year on large-scale Foundation Models</strong>.

						Large Language Models (LLMs) are shifting “what’s possible”, but require massive compute and massive complexity of distributed training
						across thousands of accelerators with traditional hardware. Cerebras Wafer Scale Clusters make training LLMs faster and easier compared
						to GPUs due to near-perfect linear scaling and simple data-parallel distribution strategy for models of any size. In this talk we will
						share our experience and insights from training various LLMs, including open-sourced family of Cerebras-GPT models, on the Cerebras hardware.

						Foundation Model is an emerging inflection point in the creation of powerful, very high dimensional data representations, triggered by advances
						in AI. Foundation Models in AI are billion-parameter-scale neural networks, powered by novel architectures which are trained using a technique
						called self-supervision. This new paradigm imposes unprecedented opportunities and challenges across the full computing stack. Hear how IBM Research
						is expanding and realizing the value of Foundation Models, from building a cloud-native supercomputing infrastructure and a simplified, cloud-native
						common stack to train and deploy Foundation Models in an multicloud environment, to applying this full stack to enable advances in natural language
						domain and beyond, including time series and code generation.

					<h3>Modeling and Mitigating Communication Bottlenecks for Large Model Training at Scale</h3>
					<h4><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tushar-krishna-a60b0970/" target="_blank">Tushar Krishna
						(Associate Professor - Georgia Institute of Technology)</a></h4>
					<p>
						The unprecedented success of large language models (LLMs) &mdash; such as Open AI's GPT-3 and GPT-4, Google's Bard, Meta's LLaMa , Cerebras-GPT and
						others &mdash; is emphasizing the ever-growing demand to efficiently train them. These models leverage billions to trillions of model parameters and
						this trend continues to increase at an unforeseen rate. The large model size makes it impossible for their parameters to fit within a single accelerator
						device, whose memory is usually capped at tens of GBs. Furthermore, even if we succeed to fit the model into a single device, their tremendous compute
						requirement leads to almost impractical training time. For example, GPT-3 consists of 175B parameters and takes 355 GPU-years to train with a single
						NVIDIA V100 GPU. This has led to a growing interest in distributed training, which is the idea of sharding model weights and/or data samples across
						multiple accelerator devices. However, this comes at the expense of communication overhead to exchange gradients and activations, and it has already
						become a key bottleneck for distributed training. We identify that the communication challenge will get exacerbated in future systems that are expected
						to leverage multi-dimensional networks with heterogeneous bandwidths due to diverse fabric technologies (e.g., chiplets, rack-scale, and scaleout).
						We present our recent works on <em>(i)</em> modeling future training platforms to identify such bottlenecks, and <em>(ii)</em> a novel runtime scheduling
						policy to enhance network bandwidth utilization.

					<h3>End-to-End Learning with Fully Homomorphic Encryption in Memory</h3>
					<h4><a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~trosing/" target="_blank">Tajana Šimunić Rosing
						(University of California, San Diego)</a></h4>
					<p>
						The increasing amount of data and the growing complexity of problems has resulted in an ever-growing reliance on cloud computing.
						However, many applications, most notably in healthcare, finance or defense, demand security and privacy which today's solutions cannot
						fully address. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) elevates the bar of today's solutions by adding confidentiality of data during processing.
						It allows computation on fully encrypted data without the need for decryption, thus fully preserving privacy. To enable processing encrypted
						data at usable levels of classic security, e.g., 128-bit, the encryption procedure introduces noticeable data size expansion &mdash; the
						ciphertext is much bigger than the native aggregate of native data types. In this talk, we present MemFHE which is the first accelerator of
						both client and server for the latest Ring-GSW (Gentry, Sahai, and Waters) based homomorphic encryption schemes using Processing In Memory
						(PIM). PIM alleviates the data movement issues with large FHE encrypted data, while providing in-situ execution and extensive parallelism
						needed for FHE’s polynomial operations. While the client-PIM can homomorphically encrypt and decrypt data, the server-PIM can process
						homomorphically encrypted data without decryption. Our server-PIM is pipelined and is designed to provide flexible bootstrapping, allowing
						two encryption techniques and various FHE security-levels based on the application requirements. We evaluate our design at various security-levels
						and compare it with state-of-the-art CPU implementations for Ring-GSW based FHE. Our system is up to 20k&times; (265&times;) faster than CPU (GPU)
						for FHE arithmetic operations and provides on average 2007&times; higher throughput than the state of the art while implementing learning algorithms
						with FHE.

					<h3>Homomorphic Computing, with a Focus on Hardware-Accelerated Homomorphic Encryption</h3>
					<h4><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/researchers/ro-cammarota.html" target="_blank">Rosario Cammarota
						(Intel)</a></h4>
					<p>
						Enabling processing encrypted data elevates the bar of confidentiality in existing security solutions and opens the front to new applications.
						It preserves individuals' privacy and market competitiveness while sustaining societal and economic growth through data sharing, collaboration,
						and artificial intelligence. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a unique family of cryptographic methods to process encrypted data. HE applications
						can reduce the risk of third-party data leakage at the processing node while preserving both data ownership and lifecycle. However, the performance
						gap that even the most efficient HE schemes hinder enabling meaningful HE applications and adopting the technology. HE applications can be a million
						times slower than the corresponding unencrypted applications on existing hardware architectures. Other barriers to adoption include the lack of
						development tools to reduce non-recurring engineering costs to build HE applications and the lack of international standards.
						Innovation in hardware architecture is the first step in bridging the performance gap and setting directions to enable meaningful technology adoption.
						In this talk, I will share Intel's innovation from theory to algorithms down to hardware architecture to allow the adoption of processing encrypted
						data with HE. Jointly with Microsoft, our Standards & Industry Organization and academic partners, we develop novel HE platforms comprehensive of
						revolutionary hardware, software libraries, development tools, and applications to make HE technologies accessible, performant, and cost-effective.
						We build an ecosystem that can sustain the exponential growth of HE-based technologies.

					<h3>Codesigning the Next Generation of Intelligent Computing Systems</h3>
					<h4><a href="https://www.pnnl.gov/people/kevin-j-barker" target="_blank">Kevin Barker
						(Pacific Northwest National Laboratory)</a></h4>
					<p>
						Convergence is driving the emergence of tightly integrated scientific workflows that combine physical simulation, machine learning, and analytics.
						However, such workflows are not well-served by existing computing capabilities that separate HPC and AI/ML computing paradigms into distinct ecosystems.
						While co-processor accelerators such as GPUs have been successfully applied to both HPC and AI/ML workloads, software stacks, programming languages, and
						programming models are still largely incompatible. Additionally, many scientific machine learning workloads exhibit characteristics that hamper their 
						performance on GPU throughput-oriented architectures. In this talk, we discuss our vision of the codesign process, as well as ongoing efforts at Pacific
						Northwest National Laboratory in codesigning hardware and software stacks to support this notion of convergence and the next generation of scientific computing.
